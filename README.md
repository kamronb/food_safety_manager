This is a piece of Software to manage Food Safety Inspections and organise and tag with geolocation the coordinates of the establishments. A food establishment register of sorts.

It shows the establishments on the map and the icon changes according to the status of the establishment. There are three states:

    - Expired (Red Icon), this is if the license expiry date has passed 
    
    - Expired soon (Yellow Icon), will within 30 days
    
    - Good Establishment (Green Icon) Will expire in more than 30 days
    
    

Planned Additions

1. Strip all character's and convert to ASCII notation to not throw off the code

2. Add pop-ups that display establishment info upon hover over the icon

3. Add First Letter of the establishment category to the icon
