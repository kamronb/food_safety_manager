This is a piece of Software to manage Food Safety Inspections and organise and tag with geolocation the coordinates of the establishments. A food establishment register of sorts.

It shows the establishments on the map and the icon changes according to the status of the establishment. There are three states:

    - Expired (Red Icon), this is if the license expiry date has passed 
    
    - Expired soon (Yellow Icon), will within 30 days
    
    - Good Establishment (Green Icon) Will expire in more than 30 days
