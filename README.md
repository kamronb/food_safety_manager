This is a piece of Software to manage Food Safety Inspections and organise and tag with geolocation the coordinates of the establishments. A food establishment register of sorts. This will allow anybody with access to monitor Food Safety activities in any given location from the local level all the way up to the regional and national level depending on user privileges.


It shows the establishments on the map and the icon changes according to the status of the establishment. There are three states:

    - Expired (Red Icon), this is if the license expiry date has passed 
    
    - Expired soon (Yellow Icon), will within 30 days
    
    - Good Establishment (Green Icon) Will expire in more than 30 days
