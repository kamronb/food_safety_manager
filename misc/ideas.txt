################################################### SCRATCH PAD (OF SORTS) ##################################################
A specific 0utline of thoughts and ideas and features and functionality to implement in the software
#############################################################################################################################

- List those inspected during the reporting period and status of last inspection along with associated notes and thing 

- Ensure that the working out in the sidebar will incorporate information from the user's data and stuff in the database, 
  therefore queries should be updated according to the user and user privileges, can choose to get push notifications (in 
  the app and/or email notifications), notifications will only be sent on weekdays, 8:30AM to 4:00PM for the following 
  pieces of information.
    - Reporting period (7 Days and 24 Hours)
    - Updates to Profile (email)
    - Changes in statuses of establishment from sat to soon expired and from soon expired to unsat, will do so first 7 days 
      in advance and 24 hours before and then the day of change in status, this list will be tracked for the month and 
      daily, weekly, monthly and special reports can be run.

- Find all the information from the user assigned in the database, so SELECT * FROM db_name WHERE inspector=OFFICER_ASSIGNED
  so it shows only the establishments associated with that Officer

- Runs and formats a listing of all the establishments done within a specific period, for reporting purposes with the option
  of listing all the inspector's comments ranging from the last 5 to the last one (get this info from storage of some sort 
  (XML, JSON, Database or external TXT file, whichever is most feasible).

- Food Inspection form to be included in a page that can be edited and notes made to store in DB (or wherever) to show (and 
  store the inspections carried out over the past year. 

- Inspections can be done on the app receipt sent to email address of the establishment and one book can be written up of the 
  inspection and the proprietor gets a copy of that and also one sent to the email address associated with the establishment 
  or one that is entered.

- User Profile Section (can get from the top in sidebar) will show user information and they can edit stuff such as email to 
  get notifications, phone number, update password, etc. It will show all the last inspections/activities, can be edited, and 
  viewed by officer and officers with advanced privileges, will track any changes (separate page)

- When adding a new establishment, the option of getting location will be used to store the location of the establishment
  in the database automatically (something like set current location or something along those lines)




######################################## IDEAS FOR HOW TO APPROACH THE PROGRAMMING ########################################
What to do in the code and how to do it
###########################################################################################################################
 - Implement the use of two databases, one with the user info and password and stuff associated with profile and assigned
   areas and so forth SHOW WORKING

 - Both databases will be dependent on each oter

 - Remember to create indexes for the rows that will be queried most




 - For the Working out of the status in the left of the screen

 Create a function that does the while loop and returns the value of the number of entries and stor that in a variable   
    
    EG: function TotalExpired () {
            count the number of values returned from DB query
            add them to $variable

        return $variable
        }

        $expired_count = TotalExpired();

    this can be done for all the queries I need to work on
