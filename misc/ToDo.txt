########################################################### TO DO ###########################################################
This is where I will list all of the features to be worked on in the order they are to be done
#############################################################################################################################
1. Work on page that shows the Establishment Profile
   - Shows the establishment alone on a map - DONE
   - Shows the Info Associated with it 
   - Do a page for each User_Profile and Update_Details Links
   - Allows user to edit info
   - Shows inspections over last year
   - Shows all notes associated with the establishment
   - Shows different statuses, shows breakdown of overall establishments in a
     pie chart, can select overall breakdown or via establishment categories

2. Add new column to database showing date of last inspection and figure out 
   a way to track last 10 inspections.

3. For login create a class of the user that will show all the required stuff like the user privileges and area assigned
   - This is for the location selection and zoom, whichever parish the user is assigned to, the map will centre on it 
     by default and have a zoom level to display all the establishments in that area in the screen of the map (select 
     screen resolution via javascript to determine zoom?)

4. Figure out a way to get the assigned areas marked off (maybe new database with location data for assigned areas), 
   figure out a way to capture all the locations within that area??? for now, it will have to be manually assigned 

5. Create info window (tooltip), show last inspected, status, name of est, owner/operator, contact info, link to profile
   page, last inspected and other useful pertinent info
