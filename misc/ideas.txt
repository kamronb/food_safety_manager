Create a global variable that counts the number of entries returned from queries for expired, soon expired and good establishments and works out the
percentage certified (including those that will expire in 30 days), uncertified and about to expire

Create a function that does the while loop and returns the value of the number of entries and stor that in a variable   
    
    EG: function TotalExpired () {
            count the number of values returned from DB query
            add them to $variable

        return $variable
        }

        $expired_count = TotalExpired();

    this can be done for all the queries I need to work on


List those inspected during the reporting period and status of last inspection along with associated notes and thing 

Inspections can be done on the app receipt sent to email address of the establishment and one book can be written up of the inspection and the 
proprietor gets a copy of that and also one sent to the email address associated with the establishment or one that is entered.
